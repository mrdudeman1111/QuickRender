### Quick Render
 This is a project I'm using to test different rendering models and abstractions in. I'm also plan to add Text rendering for a functioning UI soon.
Note: Due to issues with the LSP I use in neovim, all the headers and sources are in the base directory, I will put them all into subdirectories with their own seperate READMEs once I've implemented the UI system.
